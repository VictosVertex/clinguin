# Clinguin :penguin: 

Clinguin is a graphical-user-interface for Clingo, where one can specify the user-interface entirely in a logic-program. One might wonder how one can do this by him-/herself - for this see the descriptions below and have fun :-)

Visit the [documentation page](https://clinguin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clinguin/installation.html).

## Web-Frontend Installation

- Needed:
    - NPM/Node (default web-development setup):  [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), [NODE](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - Angular: ([installation page](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local))

Then navigate to the folder `angular_frontend`. There type `ng serve` and then go to the URL `127.0.0.1:4200` in your web-browser.
It is assumed that the backend is already started (just the `clinguin server`).
