- Use tkinter and clingo backend here
- Note that tkinter loads the image from the path in this configuration, therefore client and server must have access to local files

Start with: 
```
clinguin client-server --domain-files examples/basic/test_07/domain_file.lp --ui-files examples/basic/test_07/ui.lp
```
